## ☕ Hey there! I'm Saul and I build software systems.
I'm a hands-on technical leader, software architect and product builder that firmly believes in leading from the front, elevating my teammates and empowering those I work with to bring their full potential.

### 🧪 Right now, I'm working on...
At the moment, I'm reconnecting with the research community and cutting-edge cybersecurity tech at [NHL Stenden's Maritime IT Security Research Group](https://github.com/NHLStenden-MITS) where I work on:
* 🧠 Deceptive applications of generative AI in cybesecurity applications
* 🤖 Fully automated threat intelligence and analytics
* 🧑‍🏫 Delivery of hands-on cybersecurity workshops, interactive talks and technical demonstrations around cybersecurity (and particularly threats to/by AI-enabled systems)

### 📫 Want to get in touch?
